<H1>Raspberty Pi Love Box</H1>
<H2>Intro</H2>
Welcome to the homepage for the Raspberry Pi Love box. This project aims to make a *low* cost version of the [Lovebox](https://uk.lovebox.love/) built on the Raspberry Pi. This is a work in progress so please check back from time for time for more updates. I will be keeping an update log at the end of this page, so you can see what I've been up to recently.

The [Lovebox](https://uk.lovebox.love/) is a nifty device, that you can gift to a loved one, and then sent messages, pictures or gif's and they get displayed on the screen inside the box. To notify the user of a new message, it makes the heart on the front dance with a servo.
